# AURA Vault

One-click Mezo Trove manager. Deposit BTC, mint MUSD, hold yield-bearing savings — without juggling hints, fee bounds, or trove bookkeeping.

## What this is

`AuraVault` is a per-user smart contract that owns a single Mezo MUSD Trove on behalf of its owner. The owner gets four operations — `openVault`, `addCollateral`, `repayDebt`, `closeVault` — instead of the raw Liquity-v2-fork surface. Future work bolts on auto-yield routing (MUSD → MUSD Savings Vault) and a keeper that auto-repays debt from yield.

The hackathon scope is intentionally narrow. See `docs/research/mezo-validation.md` for the validated facts about Mezo that informed which features are in v1 vs deferred.

## Scope (week 1)

- [x] `AuraVault.sol` — per-user vault wrapping Mezo `BorrowerOperations`
- [x] Mock-based unit tests (7/7 passing)
- [x] Deploy script targeting Mezo testnet
- [x] Mezo capability audit (`docs/research/mezo-validation.md`)
- [ ] Mezo testnet deploy + manual e2e test
- [ ] Frontend (deferred to week 5)
- [ ] Auto-yield keeper (deferred to week 3)
- [ ] Account abstraction / passkeys (cut from v1 — no Mezo support)

## Known constraints (validated against Mezo deployment)

- **Min debt per Trove: 1,800 MUSD.** Cannot serve sub-$2k positions.
- **Interest rate: 1–5% APR**, locked at open. Not "1% flat" as some marketing implies.
- **Redemption fee: 0.75%** on BTC received.
- **No ERC-4337 on Mezo today.** AURA uses EOA wallets (MetaMask/UniSat/Xverse + Mezo Passport connector). BTC pays gas natively.
- **Testnet BTC is faucet-issued**, not bridged real BTC via Threshold. Mainnet uses the canonical tBTC bridge.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd contracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit   # first time only
forge build
forge test
```

Deploy to Mezo testnet (after filling `.env`):

```bash
forge script script/DeployAuraVault.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $MEZO_TESTNET_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast
```
